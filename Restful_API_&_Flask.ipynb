        "-\n",
        "  -A RESTful API is a type of API that uses the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST) to allow different systems to communicate over the internet. RESTful APIs are designed to be lightweight, scalable, and flexible, making them popular for building web services and microservices. They rely on a client-server model, where clients send requests to servers to access and manipulate resources\n",

        "  -An API (Application Programming Interface) specification is a document that defines how a software interface behaves and interacts with other software. It outlines the structure, format, and syntax of an API, essentially acting as a blueprint for building and using it.\n",
        "  -Key Aspects of an API Specification:\n",
        "    -Formal Contract: An API specification serves as a formal contract between the API provider and the API consumer, specifying what the API does and how it should be used.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    -Machine-Readable: API specifications are often written in formats like JSON or YAML, making them easily parsed by machines, which enables automation of tasks like code generation, documentation, and testing.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    -Describes API Behavior: An API specification details how the API functions, including the endpoints it offers, the data types it supports, and the expected behavior of the API in response to different requests.\n",
        "    \n",
        "    -Facilitates API Design and Development:By defining the API's structure and functionality upfront, an API specification allows developers to build a well-defined and consistent API.\n",

Its simplicity and flexibility, along with its easy-to-use nature, make it a popular choice for developers. Unlike heavier frameworks like Django, Flask is minimal, allowing developers to have more control over the application structure and add only the necessary features.\n",

        "Key aspects of url_for():\n",
        "Function-based URL Generation: Instead of directly specifying a URL path, url_for() takes the name of the view function as its first argument. Flask then uses its internal routing map to determine the correct URL associated with that function.\n",
